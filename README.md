A few simple tools to parse DGDS resource files (eg, resources from Dynamix game Rise of the Dragon).

The code is very simple, so makes a lot of assumptions.  It's only really good for local experiments.

Tools:

* reader - extract all the individual files from the volumes
* bmpparse - try to parse BMP resources from Rise of the Dragon (eg, with VQT encoding)
